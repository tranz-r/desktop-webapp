## User Stories

### Corporate Identity Establishment

As a stakeholder (investor, partner, employee, press member), I want to encounter a professionally designed corporate identity that establishes credibility and trust, so that I feel confident engaging with TRANZR GROUP LIMITED and understand the company's seriousness and capability.

**Workflow:** Stakeholders visit tranzrgroup.com and immediately see cohesive corporate branding with professional colors, typography, and layout that communicates institutional readiness and technological sophistication.

### Brand Consistency Management

As a developer, I want access to a centralized design system with predefined colors, typography scales, and reusable components, so that I can efficiently build consistent corporate experiences without manual brand interpretation.

**Workflow:** Developers use TailwindCSS configuration with corporate color tokens, Inter font family implementation, and reusable component library to ensure consistent brand application across all pages and interactions.

### Professional Credibility Communication

As an investor or business partner, I want to see carefully crafted visual hierarchy and professional design elements that reflect corporate maturity, so that I can evaluate the company's professionalism alongside business metrics.

**Workflow:** Financial stakeholders navigate through well-designed sections with clear information hierarchy, professional color schemes, and polished typography that reinforces corporate authority and strategic positioning.
