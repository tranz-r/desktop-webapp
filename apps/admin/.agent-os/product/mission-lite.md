# Product Mission (Lite)

Tranzr Admin App is a comprehensive administrative interface that helps operations teams manage quotes, users, payments, and drivers efficiently by providing real-time analytics, streamlined workflows, and centralized control over the entire moving services platform.

Tranzr Admin App serves operations managers, customer service representatives, and business analysts who need centralized control over moving services operations. Unlike traditional admin panels that require separate backend development, Tranzr Admin App leverages existing .NET Core API endpoints with enhanced authorization, providing real-time operational intelligence and unified quote management in a single interface.
