> Spec: Basic Layout with Sidebar Navigation
> Created: 2025-09-25

## Overview

Implement a responsive admin layout with collapsible sidebar navigation and main content area that provides the foundation for all admin app features. This layout will enable efficient navigation between admin modules while maintaining consistency across the application.

## User Stories

### Admin Navigation Experience

As an admin user, I want to navigate between different admin modules (Dashboard, Quotes, Users, Payments, Drivers) through a consistent sidebar interface, so that I can efficiently access all administrative functions without losing context.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin opens the admin app and sees a sidebar with navigation menu items
2. Admin clicks on a navigation item (e.g., "Quotes") 
3. The main content area updates to show the selected module
4. The active navigation item is highlighted to show current location
5. On mobile devices, admin can access navigation through a hamburger menu

### Responsive Navigation

As an admin user on a mobile device, I want to access the navigation menu through a hamburger menu that slides out from the side, so that I can navigate the admin app effectively on smaller screens.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin opens the app on a mobile device
2. Admin sees a hamburger menu icon in the header
3. Admin taps the hamburger menu icon
4. A slide-out navigation panel appears with all menu items
5. Admin selects a menu item and the panel closes, showing the selected content

## Spec Scope

1. **Responsive Sidebar Navigation** - Collapsible sidebar with navigation menu items for all admin modules
2. **Mobile Navigation** - Hamburger menu with slide-out navigation panel for mobile devices
3. **Main Content Area** - Flexible content area that displays selected module content
4. **Header Component** - Top header with logo, title, and mobile menu trigger
5. **Navigation State Management** - Active state indicators and navigation history
6. **Layout Responsiveness** - Mobile-first responsive design with proper breakpoints

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and login functionality
- Role-based navigation menu items
- User profile dropdown in header
- Search functionality in navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Advanced navigation features (nested menus, shortcuts)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Admin Layout** - Complete responsive layout with sidebar navigation that works on desktop and mobile devices
2. **Navigation Integration** - Navigation menu items that integrate with Next.js App Router for proper routing
3. **Consistent Design** - Layout that follows shadcn/ui design system and matches admin app requirements
